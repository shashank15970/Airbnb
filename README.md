# Airbnb
We cater to three user types: Customers seeking suitable listings, Potential Hosts looking to rent their property, and Hosts aiming to maximize profit. Each user's specific needs and challenges are addressed:

​

1. Customers:
   Provide tailored recommendations for the most suitable listings based on price, location (host location and neighborhood), bathrooms, and reviews.

​

2. Potential Hosts:
   Address optimal pricing, locations with the highest booking and average pricing, bathrooms, potential earnings, and identify the month with the highest average price.

​

3. Hosts:
   Ensure host identity verification, superhost status, instant booking feature, prompt response time, response rate, and highlight amenities for an enhanced property listing and increased profitability.
